            <h2>Space Fog Online Story</h2>
            <img src="story-image.webp" alt="Story Image" class="story-image">
            <p>At the end of the 21st century, a habitable planet was discovered 42 light-years from Earth. After confirming its suitability for life, a colony ship was sent. The expected travel time is 120 years, with most of the crew in a hibernation state.</p>
            <p>The spacecraft is equipped with technology to teleport nonorganic objects to the destination, as well as the ability to maintain instant communication and control of robotic avatars.</p>
            <p>Resources and robots were teleported to prepare the infrastructure on-site. The main goals of the mission include the creation of a space station suitable for human habitation, the exploration of the planet and surrounding space, and the elimination of any potential threats both in space and on the planetâ€™s surface.</p>
            <p>During the exploration, significant resource deposits were discovered in the asteroid belt around the planet, icy fog containing various valuable compounds, and dwarf planetoids rich in useful minerals.</p>
            <p>Volunteers from among the colonists are selected for remote control of the robotic avatars, ready to start their mission and take the first steps in the colonization of a new world.</p>
            <p>You are one of them.</p>
